        I am currently in my third year of pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering from Netaji Subhas University of Technology, one of Indiaâ€™s renowned institutions. As a technology enthusiast, I have developed a strong foundation in various technical areas, including Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Web Development, Machine Learning, and OpenCV.

I am currently focusing on strengthening my Competitive Programming (CP) skills while continuously enhancing my understanding of advanced technologies. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained knowledge in core subjects such as Database Management Systems (DBMS), Operating Systems, Principles of Compiler Construction, and Data Mining, which have shaped my technical proficiency.
